Your software engineering team has been hired to meet the needs of a client, a local Musical Instrument Shop. This shop is family-owned and has sold musical instruments locally for years. All of their business to-date is walk-in retail customers.

Due to the pandemic almost all sales have gone online and the shop has so far not entered the online market. They would like to enter this market with a new website. They would also like a new name and image online.

Their main requirements are:

+ Ease of use for customers and their staff
    - Quality communication between them and their customers
    - The ability for users and employees to interface with the new solution in English or Chinese
+ The website should have two portals
    - A public customer portal that has
        * The company profile, “about us”, etc. 
        * A way to communicate with the company
        * The shop products for sale
            + Musical Instrument selection
            + Services (like pickup, delivery, etc.)
        * A way to place orders (pickup / delivery, etc.)
        * A way to modify existing orders that are not yet complete
        * A way to see order status
    - A staff portal that can
        * Allow employees to organize, modify, prioritize, update and keep track of orders in the system including adding new items for sale.
        * Change any part of how sales are handled due to the pandemic. For instance, if the physical shop closes, collection is no longer possible. 
        * See and respond to communications from customers.

Technical requirements include:
+ Cloud-based (must be accessible anywhere on earth via a web browser). Must be hosted on UCD server that will be provided to you.
+ Accessible via a mobile device 
    - A separate downloadable app is not required, nor desired. But the web interface should have a display and interaction (menus, etc.) that are adapted for mobile devices when customers access the site with a mobile device. 
    - No downloads, app installations, or special software should be required.
+ All data on customers, orders, etc. should be stored in a database.
+ Security
+ Reliability
+ Other features that you as the software engineers think are important. These should be specified in your final documentation and video if you include them. 

Importantly, the owners of the shop are very new to online commerce. Part of why they want to hire your team is so that you can make recommendations to make their new online business the best it can be. So, you can, and should, add in features, etc. that you think would be useful for them. 

However the core requirements above must be met. You should make it a focus of your team’s 
solution to consider this, and to make your solution unique for this customer. 

Special note: Usernames/passwords for customer and staff accounts need to be supplied for testing purposes. Although you may have a way for new customers to register, etc. this should not be the only way that your solution is tested. In other words, when we test your solution, we should not need to register new accounts.
